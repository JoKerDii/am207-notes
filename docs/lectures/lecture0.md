## Goals

1. Build statistical (Bayesian and non-Bayesian) models for: continuous, ordinal, and categorical data
2. Study algorithms for model fitting and inference
3. Study paradigms for model evaluation and critique

**Goal**: becoming familiar with standard statistical models and modern techniques of inference. After this course, students should be able to productively read current machine learning research papers.

**Focus**: 

* Why: theory should serve a concrete purpose

  *If you fine yourself reading a piece of theory and you can't answer the question of why you would possibly care about the implication of this piece of theory, then you need to keep digging until you care.*

* How: emphasize computational aspects of inference

**Related other courses**:

* Bayesian Inference (Stats)
* Advanced Machine Learning (CS)
* Computational Statistics (Stats)
